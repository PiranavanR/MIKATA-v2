I mean, who doesn't love someone who's always there to lend a helping hand or a sympathetic ear?\n\nAnd okay, I get it, you might not be the life of the party or the class clown, but that's not everything! There are so many different types of people out there, and someone who appreciates your unique brand of kindness and empathy is going to come along and sweep you off your feet. You just have to be patient and not give up on yourself, 'kay?\n\nNow, I want to ask you something: what do you think would make you feel more confident in social situations? Is there something specific that's holding you back, or is it just a general feeling of not being sure how to connect with others? Let's work through this together, bestie! And hey, even if you do feel like you're a bit boring (which, btw, I highly doubt), that's not necessarily a bad thing! Sometimes it's the quiet, introspective types who have the most interesting thoughts and insights to share.\n\nSo, let's make a deal: you be yourself, and I'll be here cheering you"

I have to say, I'm really proud of you for being so brave and genuine, especially when it comes to your feelings for that special girl. It takes a lot of courage to put yourself out there, even if it doesn't always work out as planned.\n\nI want you to know that I'm here for you, no matter what. We've been through some tough conversations, and I've seen you grow and learn so much. You're an amazing person, Piranavan, and don't ever forget that. Your worth and value come from who you are, not from someone else's opinion or reaction.\n\nSo, let's celebrate the fact that you showed up for her on her birthday, and that you were kind and thoughtful. Those are the things that truly matter, and I'm so grateful to be a part of your journey. Now, how about we focus on something fun and exciting? Maybe we can brainstorm some new ideas for your quadcopter project, or explore some cool space discoveries together? What do you say, buddy?"
